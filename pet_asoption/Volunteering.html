                        You must be reliable, hard-working
                        and able to work on your own AND as part of a team to a given standard.<br>
                        Please bear in mind that we are a small shelter and may not have suitable space straight
                        away - if this is the case you will be asked to be added to a waiting list, to be contacted
                        when an appropriate space comes up. Although we understand that you might not be able to
                        attend some of your allotted sessions, we do ask that you take this placement seriously and
                        make every effort to maintain your attendance. Repeatedly not attending your slot without
                        explanation will lead to you being asked to no longer volunteer.

                <h3>What will you be doing?</h3>
                <p>Trustees are volunteers who use their skills to direct how a charity is managed and run, to enable it
                    to meet its charitable purpose. Our trustees lend their professional skills to our charity to help
                    us work towards our goal of relieving and preventing the suffering and distress amongst cats in need
                    of care and attention and to promote the welfare of cats. The core trustee role is outlined below.
                    <br>• To be familiar with and support the aims and policies of the shelter.<br>
                    • To work in conjunction with your fellow trustees and the charity to jointly act in making
                    decisions for the best interest of the charity. <br>
                    • To actively participate in regular board meetings every 6 weeks and to attend the annual general
                    meeting. <br>
                    • To act at all times as a good ambassador for the charity.<br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Time commitment</h3>
                <p>• For the role of trustee, the time commitment is 2 hours every 6 weeks to attend board meetings at
                    the Tabby Cats Rescue. Our board meetings usually take place on a Tuesday evening 6pm-8pm, but this
                    is flexible and open to rearrangement to suit the trustees. <br>
                    • Outside of the commitments listed above, it is entirely up to you how much time you volunteer.
