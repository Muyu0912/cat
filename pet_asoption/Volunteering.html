                            Please bear in mind that we are a small shelter and may not have suitable space straight
                            away - if this is the case you will be asked to be added to a waiting list, to be contacted
                            when an appropriate space comes up. Although we understand that you might not be able to
                            attend some of your allotted sessions, we do ask that you take this placement seriously and
                            make every effort to maintain your attendance. Repeatedly not attending your slot without
                            explanation will lead to you being asked to no longer volunteer.

                    <strong> Events Organiser </strong><br>

                    As a voluntary events organiser you’ll play a key role in organising and running our awareness
                    and fundraising events. Working in conjunction with our Shelter management team, you’ll be
                    involved in the planning of our events as well as ensuring that everything runs as smoothly as
                    possible. This voluntary role will suit a person who has helped organise events before, or who
                    is studying for an events management career. For more details, please email us.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Events Volunteer </strong><br>

                    As an events volunteer you’ll assist an events organiser at our exciting events across Yorkshire
                    throughout the year. 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of the Tabby Cats Rescue, and we’ll be
                    celebrating in style. Our events will provide a great opportunity for us to spread the message
                    about our vital work as well as contributing to our fundraising efforts. This role is perfect
                    for enthusiastic volunteers who love cats, love events and love meeting people. Experience is
                    great, but enthusiasm is even more important!
