        <h2>How to Rehome From Us</h2>
        <p><strong>We work really hard to find each adopter the right cat. Sadly, many of the cats in our care have been
                victims of cruelty which means they often require a period of rehabilitation before they are ready to be
                rehomed. When our volunteers believe they are ready they will observe their behaviour and give them a
                health check which helps us match their needs to a suitable person or family.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Many of the cats in our care have had a tough time, so it’s very important that their next
                    home is
                    the right home and a home for life. That’s why we ask anyone who’s thinking of rehoming from us
                    to fill
                    in an application form before being interviewed with one of our rescue centre volunteers.
                </strong><br>We find this is the best way to find out more about you and help you to choose the
                right cat.
                We really believe there is a home to suit every cat in our care. But, sometimes it just takes a
                little time
                to find our feline friends the perfect home.

            <li>
                We carry out a home-visit and in some cases suggest minor changes that help ensure your home is as cat
                friendly as possible. We’ll also call or visit after your cat has moved in to make sure you and your new
                cat are adjusting well to your new life together.

            </li>
            <li>
                All cats that are over the age of 6 months are neutered before rehoming. If adopting a cat that is
                younger than 6 months, Tabby Cats Rescue will provide a voucher for half price neutering at a York-based
                veterinarian.

            <li>
                A fee of <strong>£50</strong> per cat is charged upon rehoming a cat which contributes to the running
                costs of Tabby Cat Rescue.

                <p><strong>Jazzy, Joey, Jenny & Jim</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Jazzy, Joey, Jenny and Jim are our family of 4 adorable ginger kittens. The kittens were found in a
                    box
                    at the
                    side of the road when they were just 3 weeks old. They are now 8 weeks old and looking for new
                    families.
                    These
                    kittens have been through a lot in their short lives and must be rehomed in pairs. They are playful
                    and
                    excitable and enjoy lots of attention.

                <p>
                    Milly came to us when her owner passed away suddenly. Milly is about 8 years old. She loves to be
                    outdoors and
                    must be rehomed to a family where there is space for her to roam and explore. Milly has lived with
                    other
                    animals
                    before and can be rehomed into a family with other pets. Milly has been with us for 6 months now and
                    desperately
                    wants a new home.

                <p><strong>Fonzie</strong></p>
                Fonzie is a very cool character. He’s been at Tabby Cats for over a year now, as he arrived in a sad and
                neglected condition. His previous owners had not taken care of him properly and his gorgeous fur was all
                matted
                and dirty and full of nasty bugs. It’s taken a lot of hard work from the volunteers, but Fonzie is now
                ready for
                rehoming. Fonzie is a bit shy and timid until he gets to know you, but once he feels comfortable around
                someone
                he is a very affectionate little dude. Fonzie requires a home where he is the only pet, and there are no
                young
                children. His fur needs regular grooming to keep in its current healthy state.

                <p><strong>Bill & Ben </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Bill (the ginger cat) and Ben (the tabby) are a pair of 5 year old cats who have lived together
                    their
                    whole
                    lives. They aren’t brothers, but they may as well be. They came to Tabby Cats when their family
                    emigrated to
                    Australia and decided they couldn’t take the cats with them. Given they are very close, Bill and Ben
                    must be
                    rehomed together. In many ways Bill and Ben are opposites. Bill is not the cleverest cat we’ve had
                    in
                    Tabby Cats
                    rescue, but he is a sweetheart and will always enjoy a cuddle. Ben, on the other hand, is incredibly
                    smart and
                    savvy. He knows what he wants (usually more food), and he knows how to get it (by pretending he
                    hasn’t
                    just been
                    fed). Bill and Ben are used to being allowed to play inside and out so need to be in a quiet area
                    with a
                    cat
                    flap. Bill and Ben are used to young children and dogs

                <p>
                Cindy is our 12 year old tortoieshell princess. She’s a diva and she knows it. She’s smart but also
                incredible
                loving and would be a great companion for someone. She really loves to have her tummy rubbed. She’s an
                indoor-only cat and can’t be rehomed into a family where there are other pets. She would suit an older
                couple or
                individual, particularly someone who’s retired and can give her the company that she requires.

                <p><strong>Tabitha</strong></p>
                Tabitha is a gorgeous outdoor tabby cat who was found rummaging for food at a household waste centre.
                She’s very
                tame for a stray cat and loves being around people, so we think she was a pet that lost her owners
                somehow. We
                think she’s about 3 years old. Tabitha needs some outdoor space, and would love to live somewhere with a
                big
                garden to explore.
