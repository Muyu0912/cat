        <h2>How to Rehome From Us</h2>
        <p><strong>We work really hard to find each adopter the right cat. Sadly, many of the cats in our care have been
                victims of cruelty which means they often require a period of rehabilitation before they are ready to be
                rehomed. When our volunteers believe they are ready they will observe their behaviour and give them a
                health check which helps us match their needs to a suitable person or family.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Many of the cats in our care have had a tough time, so it’s very important that their next
                    home is
                    the right home and a home for life. That’s why we ask anyone who’s thinking of rehoming from us
                    to fill
                    in an application form before being interviewed with one of our rescue centre volunteers.
                </strong><br>We find this is the best way to find out more about you and help you to choose the
                right cat.
                We really believe there is a home to suit every cat in our care. But, sometimes it just takes a
                little time
                to find our feline friends the perfect home.

            <li>
                We carry out a home-visit and in some cases suggest minor changes that help ensure your home is as cat
                friendly as possible. We’ll also call or visit after your cat has moved in to make sure you and your new
                cat are adjusting well to your new life together.

                    Neutering
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                All cats that are over the age of 6 months are neutered before rehoming. If adopting a cat that is
                younger than 6 months, Tabby Cats Rescue will provide a voucher for half price neutering at a York-based
                veterinarian.

            </li>
            <li>
                A fee of <strong>£50</strong> per cat is charged upon rehoming a cat which contributes to the running
                costs of Tabby Cat Rescue.
