                Come along to one of our open evenings to meet the current cat residents, chat with our volunteers, find

                more about what we do and why we need your help to keep the charity running!<br><br>

                If you’re thinking about rehoming a cat, our open evenings are the perfect opportunity to drop by and
                find
                out if you’re suitable for rehoming one of our cats. We’re sure that you’ll fall in love with at least
                one
                of the current residents, but if not we can take your details and contact you if a more suitable cat
                moves
                into the centre.

            <p><strong>Saturday July 13th – Summer BBQ and Open Day: 12pm – 5pm</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Our annual summer BBQ and open day is our opportunity to thank our volunteers for all their hard work
                and give a little bit back to the local community. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Come by for some delicious BBQ food, including locally sourced meat and vegetables, and perhaps a pint
                of our delicious homemade cider or two. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The event is suitable for children and there will be face painters, a bouncy castle and other crafty
                stalls to keep them entertained – as well as playing with the cats of course! <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be a raffle with lots of amazing prizes to be won. We’ll also have our infamous bread and
                cakes stall to make sure you are nicely full up. <br>
