        <h2>The History of Tabby Cats Rescue</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong> Tabby Cats Rescue </strong> is a small, independent cat rescue centre run by <strong>Hazel
                O’Brien</strong> and her husband <strong> Éamonn </strong> at their home in the East Riding of
            Yorkshire town of Pocklington. <strong> Hazel </strong> has commissioned you to design and develop a
            website for their rescue centre to help publicise the cats they have available for adoption and
            encourage donations.

            Tabby Cats Rescue was established in May 2004 when Hazel found a box containing 5 kittens (approximately 3
            weeks old) at the side of the road. Hazel tried to find a cat rescue centre to take in these kittens and put
            them up for adoption, but was unable to find spaces for them altogether as all the rescue centres were
            overrun. The kittens were so young that Hazel was reluctant to separate them across different cat rescue
            centres. Hazel and Éamonn already had 3 cats of their own, so they couldn’t keep the kittens permanently.
            So instead, they decided to take care of the kittens until they were old enough to be rehomed and then try
            to rehome the kittens themselves. Éamonn is a skilled carpenter and quickly got to work building a nice
            shelter for the kittens in the back garden of the bungalow. <br>
            <strong> As such, Tabby Cats Rescue was born! </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since that day in May 2004, Tabby Cats Rescue has expanded and now has room for up to 30 adults cats to live
            comfortably and has rehomed hundreds of cats and kittens. From pedigree Ragdoll cats to strays, all cats are
            welcome at Tabby Cats Rescue no matter what their age or condition. If any cat is unsuitable for rehoming,
            perhaps as a result of being harmed or mistreated, then Tabby Cats Rescue will take care of them
            permanently. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cats are only rehomed to people who can demonstrate a love of cats and a commitment to loving them and
            taking care of them properly. Some cats are suitable to families with children, while others are more
            appropriate to older, child free environments. Some cats are able to be rehomed into locations with an
            outside environment, while others are better in an indoor-only set up. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            All cats that are over the age of 6 months are neutered before rehoming. If adopting a cat that is younger
            than 6 months, Tabby Cats Rescue will provide a voucher for half price neutering at a York-based
            veterinarian. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tabby Cats Rescue is funded through the generosity of the public, through fundraising events hosted by
            volunteers, and a small fee charged to people adopting the cats. <br>
